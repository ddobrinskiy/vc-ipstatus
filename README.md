## Features

- **Real-time VPN detection** - Automatically detects when you connect/disconnect from VPN
- **Country flag display** - Shows your current IP location as a flag emoji in the menu bar
- **IP geolocation** - Displays country, city, and IP address in the dropdown menu
- **Shield indicator** - Shows checkmark shield (✓🛡️) when VPN is connected, X shield (⊗🛡️) when disconnected
- **No dock icon** - Runs quietly in your menu bar without cluttering your dock

## Download

### Latest Release: v1.0.0

[**Download VPNStatus.zip**](https://github.com/ddobrinskiy/VPNStatus-macos-menubar/releases/download/v1.0.0/VPNStatus.zip)

## Installation

1. Download `VPNStatus.zip` from the latest release
2. Unzip the file
3. Move `VPNStatus.app` to `/Applications`
4. Double-click to run (or launch from Spotlight)

### First Launch

On first launch, macOS may show a security warning since the app isn't signed with an Apple Developer certificate:

1. Right-click (or Control-click) on `VPNStatus.app`
2. Select "Open" from the context menu
3. Click "Open" in the dialog that appears

The app will now run and appear in your menu bar.

## Usage

- **Menu bar icon** shows:
  - `✓🛡️ + 🇪🇪` - VPN connected (with VPN exit country flag)
  - `⊗🛡️ + 🇷🇺` - VPN disconnected (with your real country flag)

- **Click the icon** to see:
  - Connection status
  - Current country, city, and IP address
  - Active VPN interfaces

- **Keyboard shortcuts**:
  - `⌘R` - Refresh status
  - `⌘Q` - Quit

## How It Works

The app detects VPN connections by monitoring network interfaces for VPN tunnels (utun, ppp, ipsec, tap, tun). It specifically looks for interfaces with IPv4 addresses to distinguish actual VPN connections from system services like iCloud Private Relay.
